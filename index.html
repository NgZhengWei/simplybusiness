Whether you’re a self-employed cleaner, tradesman, beauty therapist or dog walker, you want specialist small business insurance tailored to your needs – so that’s what we provide. And as landlords need flexible cover too, our landlord insurance can cover things like buildings, contents and loss of rent.</p>

Pick your core covers, from public liability insurance for injury and property damage, to employers’ liability insurance for your staff. And there are options for different risks, like professional indemnity insurance, or protection for your business equipment.</p>
